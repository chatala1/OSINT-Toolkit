# OSINT-Framework

> ### Definition of OSINT (Open Source Intelligence):
> OSINT is defined in the United States of America by Public Law 109-163 as cited by both the U.S. Director of National Intelligence and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), as intelligence "produced from publicly available information that is collected, exploited, and disseminated in a timely manner to an appropriate audience for the purpose of addressing a specific intelligence requirement." As defined by NATO, OSINT is intelligence "derived from publicly available information, as well as other unclassified information that has limited public distribution or access."

## What is the OSINT Framework? How can you use it?
* The OSINT Framework provides a structured approach to gathering publicly available information, expanding in scope due to the internet and digital communications, and offering tools and techniques for open-source data analysis.
* OSINT tools within the framework enable effective data harvesting from various online sources, including social media and search engines. They also extend to exploring the Deep and Dark Web, offering insights across multiple sectors.
* Ethical considerations in OSINT gathering are crucial, requiring adherence to legal standards such as GDPR and the ethical collection of data, while respecting terms of service and maintaining transparency.

&nbsp;
## Exploring the OSINT Framework: A Primer
Open-source intelligence (OSINT) involves gathering publicly accessible data from sources like:
* News articles
* Social media posts
* Government reports
* Online forums
* Other OSINT resources

> **Note:**
> *The concept of OSINT originated in military intelligence settings where it was used for espionage and strategic intelligence through media like newspapers and radio broadcasts. With the growth of the internet and digital communications, the scope and impact of OSINT have significantly expanded. The OSINT Framework provides a structured method for performing open-source intelligence tasks, benefiting security researchers, government agencies, and cybersecurity professionals in information gathering.*

&nbsp;
## Utilizing OSINT Tools for Effective Data Harvesting
The OSINT Framework, besides being an exhaustive source for data collection on multiple targets, can also function as a cybersecurity checklist for scrutinizing individuals or corporations. Tools like Shodan are used to find intelligence about devices and vulnerabilities, while Spyse collects data on websites, their owners, and associated servers.

> **The Harvester:**
> &nbsp;
> Searches for relevant information from public sources like search engines and social media platforms, displaying results including email addresses and social media profiles. Specialized tools like Spiderfoot integrate with multiple data sources for free and are easily accessible via platforms like GitHub.

*These tools and resources aid in obtaining real-time insights into current events, incidents, and trends to enhance situational awareness.*

### Search Engines and Directories
Search engines are crucial in the realm of OSINT. According to Statcounter, Baidu, owns a 61% market share in China, and Yandex, commanding over 71% of the Russian desktop search market (source: Statista), are essential for OSINT due to their widespread use. These search engines provide a wealth of localized data that can be leveraged for intelligence gathering.

Moreover, region-specific search engines such as Naver in South Korea and Seznam in the Czech Republic are particularly useful for OSINT, providing localized and tailored search results relevant to their respective areas. Privacy-focused search engines like DuckDuckGo are also vital for OSINT pursuits where users require searches unlinked to their personal browsing history.

### Social Media Monitoring
Social media platforms offer a wealth of data for OSINT. Social Mention, a social media search engine, focuses on specific terms and phrases, pulling results from over one hundred social media platforms. This tool allows analysts to gather a vast amount of information from various platforms, enhancing their ability to gather comprehensive data.

Trendsmap is used to analyze trending Twitter keywords and hashtags, featuring a robust spam detection system to ensure trend authenticity. Similarly,Hashatit allows users to search and analyze active hashtags across multiple social media platforms, collecting related posts in one place. These tools considerably bolster social media monitoring capabilities, an important facet of OSINT.

### Deep and Dark Web Exploration
The Deep and Dark Web, often seen as the internet’s underbelly, holds valuable information for OSINT. This part of the web is not indexed by conventional search engines and requires specialized tools like the Tor browser for access. TorBot, a Python-based OSINT tool for the dark web, is designed to crawl and index .onion sites, returning information such as page titles, addresses, and descriptions, while storing the results in a JSON format.

> **Incorporating dark web monitoring:** is essential for a comprehensive OSINT strategy, enabling ongoing surveillance of illicit activities. Maltego, used in conjunction with Elasticsearch and Kibana, allows analysts to visualize and analyze dark web data through storage and complex query execution. Ahmia.fi serves as a deep web search engine that gathers .onion URLs from the Tor network, creating a significant index of such content. These tools and resources assist in probing the deep and dark web, a key component of OSINT.
